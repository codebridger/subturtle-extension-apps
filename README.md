## Project Overview

Subturtle is a Chrome extension designed to help users learn English while watching videos online. It provides features such as word translation on hover, full subtitle translation, and detailed word information. The extension supports platforms like YouTube and Netflix, with plans for more.

---

## Architecture

### Main Modules

- **Background Scripts:** Handle background tasks, Chrome API interactions, and messaging.
- **Popup UI:** The extension popup, providing quick access to features and settings.
- **Console Crane App:** The main extension app rendered in a web page, with its own router and features such as word detail and (in the future) settings.
- **Subtitle Injection:** Injects and manages subtitles on supported video sites.
- **Common Utilities:** Shared helpers, services, icons, and types.
- **Plugins:** Integrations and additional features (e.g., Mixpanel analytics, modular REST).
- **State Management:** Centralized state for user data, settings, and app state.

### Data Flow

- User interacts with video page or popup.
- Content scripts inject subtitle features and communicate with background scripts.
- Background scripts handle API calls, storage, and messaging.
- Popup and Console Crane App interact with background and content scripts for real-time updates.
